# Enhanced Status - Sale Order Workflow Module

## Overview

The Enhanced Status module provides a comprehensive workflow enhancement for Odoo 17 sale orders, featuring custom stages, financial tracking, professional commission reporting, and **percentage-based quantity display**.

## 🎯 Latest Update: Version 17.0.1.0.1

### Percentage Quantity Display

**NEW:** Quantities now display as percentages (e.g., **3.80%** instead of 0.0380 Units)

**Features:**
- ✅ Quantities display as percentages with exactly 2 decimal places
- ✅ Consistent format between sale orders and invoices  
- ✅ Fixed rounding issues that caused incorrect invoice status
- ✅ Automatic data migration to correct existing records

**What Changed:**
- Sale order line quantities: `3.80%` (was: 0.0380 Units)
- Invoiced quantities: `3.80%` (was: 0.0380 Units)
- Invoice quantities: `3.80%` (was: 0.0380 Units)
- Exact 2 decimal precision prevents rounding errors (3.8% no longer displays as 4%)

**See:** `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for deployment instructions and `PERCENTAGE_QUANTITY_SUMMARY.md` for complete details.
